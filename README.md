PLS read the readme inside ssy236_project\rearrange_ws\src\pointout\world_percept_assig3, but notice that you need to source tiago ws...  
It can naviagtion and point out, even through it is not very accurate.

Update a new node that can read the command in txt and pub to goal_rtopic_test node to move tiago

 ### TODO List:   
 ```
Pls help to add cola or Beer in the Gazebo Map....  
In addition, let's think about how to add learning to reasoning and make it more complex. . . 
This will be simpler than performing complex operations in ROS.
